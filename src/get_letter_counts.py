### STEP ONE ###

Creates normalized histogram of first letter of US baby names based on data from 1880 to 2024
found here: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html

Histogram is used to bias the list of celebrity names we scrape from online to ensure we are
getting popular celebrities that are well sampled, i.e., lots of celebrities with names starting with J
but not many with names starting with X.
